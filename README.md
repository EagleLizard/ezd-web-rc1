## Tech

1. Typescript @ `^5.9.x`+
2. React, ReactDOM @ `^19.1.x`+
3. Vite @ `^7.1.x`+
4. tanstack/react-router @ `^1.131.x`+

## why?

I want to use plain static html for a bunch of my content. Some things are easier for me to think about as a traditional singe-page-application (SPA).

## style

I like a lot of the concepts in [tufte css](https://edwardtufte.github.io/tufte-css/).
